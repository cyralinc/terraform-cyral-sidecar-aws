# This module has been deprecated

Refer to the new module `terraform-aws-sidecar-ec2` in the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/cyralinc/sidecar-ec2/aws/latest)
or in [GitHub](https://github.com/cyralinc/terraform-aws-sidecar-ec2).

If you are already using the following `source`, your Terraform is already referring to the new module and no changes are required:

```hcl
module "cyral_sidecar" {
    source  = "cyralinc/sidecar-ec2/aws"
    ...
```
